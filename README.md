# manim-tutorials

This repo contains tutorials for using manim module for animations, there is some animations used on my [Data Structures](https://github.com/init-nahuel/data-structures) repo too.

You can run the animations using the command:

```bash
$ manim -pqh file_name.py AnimationScene
```

Where `AnimationScene` is the python class inside the file where the animation is created. There are so many options when running `manim`, but commonly we use the flags `-p` to play the animation right before running the command and `-qh` to render the animation in high quality.
